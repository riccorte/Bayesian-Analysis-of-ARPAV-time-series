# Bayesian Regression for Weather Forecasting

This project explores the use of **Bayesian inference techniques** for regression-based weather forecasting, using time series data provided by **ARPAV** (Agenzia Regionale per la Prevenzione e Protezione Ambientale del Veneto).  
The work focused on building probabilistic models that not only predict weather variables but also quantify the **uncertainty** associated with those predictions, offering an advantage over classical regression approaches.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Objective:** Apply Bayesian regression to ARPAV time series data for weather forecasting.  
- **Methods:**
  - Regression models in a **Bayesian inference** framework.
  - Posterior distribution analysis of model parameters.
  - Uncertainty quantification for predictions.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, PyMC / Stan, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Results
- Developed Bayesian regression models adapted to ARPAV meteorological data.
- Highlighted how probabilistic models provide a richer interpretation of forecast uncertainty.
- Comparison with traditional approaches showed increased robustness to noisy or incomplete datasets.
