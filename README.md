# Bayesian Regression for Weather Forecasting

This project looks at how **Bayesian regression** can be used to improve weather forecasting using data from **ARPAV** (Agenzia Regionale per la Prevenzione e Protezione Ambientale del Veneto).  
Instead of just predicting future values, the idea was to also measure how **certain or uncertain** those predictions are — which is really important when dealing with something as complex as the weather.



## What We Did
- Collected and cleaned **time series data** from ARPAV.  
- Built regression models in a **Bayesian framework**.  
- Explored the **posterior distributions** of the parameters.  
- Compared the Bayesian approach with more traditional regression methods.  



## Tools We Used
- **Python** for data analysis and modeling  
- **PyMC / Stan** for Bayesian inference  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization  


## Credits
This project was developed in collaboration with:  
- **Alessandro Miotto**
